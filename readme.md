## GrinnyBot Discord Project

- Fun project for my/friends Discord server to create a bot which has features we can use to benefit the server.

- Project was also used as a springboard to learn TypeScript
- Also greatly improved my understanding of working with APIs to fetch data, dealing with promises and creating type interfaces

- First feature was a simple weather functionality so we can simply type in the chat and see eachothers weather conditions:
