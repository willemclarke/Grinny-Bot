## GrinnyBot Discord Project

- Fun project for my/friends Discord server to create a bot which has features we can use to benefit the server.

- Project was also used as a springboard to learn TypeScript
- Also greatly improved my understanding of working with APIs to fetch data, dealing with promises and creating type interfaces

- First feature was a simple weather functionality so we can simply type in the chat and see eachothers weather conditions:

- Second feature utilises the JIKAN (unoffical MyAnimeList API) to display anime and manga data to the user. This command was interesting to make as I got to utilise the [plotly](https://plot.ly/nodejs/getting-started/#getting-started-with-plotly-for-nodejs) graphing library to display user rating statistics for each anime/manga.

* Third feature utilises NASA API to display Astronomy Picture of the Day - Posted by the bot automatically every 24hrs, and by user request (!nasa):
